# 🔧 **COMBO SYSTEM FIXES COMPLETED**

## ✅ **ALL 5 CRITICAL ISSUES SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED**

### **🎯 Issue 1: "Make it a Combo" for Chicken Bites**
**Problem**: Chicken bites menu items didn't have combo option available.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Added `_getChickenBitesExtras()` method in `menu_extras.dart`
- ✅ Included combo upgrade option with drink + side selection (+$8.50)
- ✅ Added dipping sauce extras (Ranch, Honey Mustard, BBQ, Buffalo)
- ✅ Updated category mapping to include 'chicken bites' and 'chicken-bites'

**Result**: Chicken bites now have full combo functionality with sauce options.

### **🎯 Issue 2: Whole Wings & Chicken Pieces Combo Selection**
**Problem**: Wings and chicken pieces had combo options but didn't trigger drink+sides selection.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Fixed combo extra IDs from `wings_combo_upgrade` and `pieces_combo_upgrade` to standard `combo_upgrade`
- ✅ Updated descriptions to match standard combo format
- ✅ Ensured consistent combo behavior across all menu categories

**Result**: Wings and chicken pieces now properly open combo selection screen.

### **🎯 Issue 3: Cart Calculation for Sandwich + Bun Choice**
**Problem**: Cart wasn't calculating sandwich prices correctly with bun upgrades, and bun choices weren't reflected properly.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Enhanced Cart Model**: Added `ComboMeal` support to `CartItem` class
- ✅ **Fixed Price Logic**: Implemented proper bun upgrade calculation for sandwiches
  - Base price + (selected bun price - lowest bun price)
  - Texas Toast (free) vs Brioche (+$1) properly calculated
- ✅ **Added Helper Methods**: `isCombo` and `displayName` getters for UI
- ✅ **Combo Support**: Full combo meal price calculation integration

**Technical Details**:
```dart
// For sandwiches: proper bun upgrade calculation
if (menuItem.category.toLowerCase().contains('sandwich')) {
  final bunPrice = menuItem.sizes![selectedSize]!;
  final lowestPrice = menuItem.sizes!.values.reduce((a, b) => a < b ? a : b);
  basePrice = lowestPrice + (bunPrice - lowestPrice);
}
```

**Result**: Accurate pricing for all sandwich + bun combinations and combo meals.

- ✅ **Improved Card Layout**: Added `Flexible` widget for text and proper spacing
- ✅ **Fixed Dropdown**: Constrained dropdown height to 30px with proper styling
