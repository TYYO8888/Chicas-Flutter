# 🔧 Complete Flutter Reinstallation Guide

## 🚨 **ISSUE CONFIRMED: Corrupted Flutter Installation**

The persistent `<< was unexpected at this time` errors indicate your Flutter installation is corrupted and needs complete reinstallation.

## **📋 STEP 1: Uninstall Current Flutter**

### **1.1 Find Flutter Installation Location**
Open Command Prompt (as Administrator) and run:
```cmd
echo %PATH%
```
Look for Flutter paths like:
- `C:\flutter\bin`
- `C:\src\flutter\bin`
- `C:\tools\flutter\bin`
- `%USERPROFILE%\flutter\bin`

### **1.2 Remove Flutter Directory**
Once you find the Flutter directory, delete it completely:
```cmd
# Example if Flutter is in C:\flutter
rmdir /s /q C:\flutter

# Or if in user profile
rmdir /s /q %USERPROFILE%\flutter
```

### **1.3 Clean Environment Variables**
1. Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, press Enter
2. Click "Environment Variables"
3. In both "User variables" and "System variables":
   - Remove any Flutter paths from `PATH`
   - Remove `FLUTTER_ROOT` variable if it exists
   - Remove `PUB_CACHE` variable if it exists

### **1.4 Clean Registry (Optional but Recommended)**
1. Press `Win + R`, type `regedit`, press Enter
2. Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software`
3. Delete any Flutter-related entries
4. Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE`
5. Delete any Flutter-related entries

## **📦 STEP 2: Fresh Flutter Installation**

### **2.1 Download Flutter**
1. Go to https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
2. Download the latest stable Flutter SDK
3. Extract to `C:\flutter` (recommended location)

### **2.2 Update PATH Environment Variable**
1. Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, press Enter
2. Click "Environment Variables"
3. Under "User variables", select `PATH` and click "Edit"
4. Click "New" and add: `C:\flutter\bin`
5. Click "OK" to save

### **2.3 Verify Installation**
Open a **NEW** Command Prompt and run:
```cmd
flutter --version
flutter doctor
```

## **🔧 STEP 3: Configure Flutter**

### **3.1 Accept Android Licenses (if using Android)**
```cmd
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

### **3.2 Enable Web Support**
```cmd
flutter config --enable-web
```

### **3.3 Clear Any Cached Data**
```cmd
flutter clean
flutter pub cache repair
```

## **🧪 STEP 4: Test Installation**

### **4.1 Create Test Project**
```cmd
cd C:\temp
flutter create test_app
cd test_app
flutter pub get
```

### **4.2 Test Web Build**
```cmd
flutter build web
```

If these commands work without the `<< was unexpected` errors, your installation is fixed.

## **🎯 STEP 5: Return to Your Project**

Once Flutter is working:

1. **Navigate back to your project:**
   ```cmd
   cd "d:\Bizness\7thSenseMediaLabz\Chica's Chicken Flutter"
   ```

2. **Clean your project:**
   ```cmd
   flutter clean
   ```

3. **Get dependencies:**
   ```cmd
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Test your app:**
   ```cmd
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

## **🚨 ALTERNATIVE: Use Flutter Version Manager (FVM)**

If you want better Flutter version management:

### **Install FVM:**
```cmd
dart pub global activate fvm
```

### **Install Flutter via FVM:**
```cmd
fvm install stable
fvm global stable
```

## **🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES**

### **Issue: PATH not updating**
- Restart your computer after changing PATH
- Use Command Prompt, not PowerShell initially
- Check PATH with: `echo %PATH%`

### **Issue: Permission errors**
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Ensure antivirus isn't blocking Flutter

### **Issue: Network/Proxy problems**
```cmd
flutter config --clear-features
git config --global http.proxy http://your-proxy:port
```

### **Issue: Still getting << errors**
- Your terminal might be corrupted
- Try Windows Terminal or Git Bash instead of PowerShell
- Restart your computer

## **📞 NEXT STEPS AFTER REINSTALLATION**

1. ✅ Verify `flutter doctor` shows no critical issues
2. ✅ Test with minimal project first
3. ✅ Return to your Chica's Chicken project
4. ✅ Gradually add back dependencies from `pubspec_backup.yaml`
5. ✅ Uncomment service imports once dependencies resolve

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Do NOT skip the environment variable cleanup - old Flutter paths can cause conflicts with the new installation.
